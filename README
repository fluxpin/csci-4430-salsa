The SALSA source for my solution to a ProgLang problem.

SALSA is an actor-oriented language based on Java under development at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The version needed to build and run the
program is included in this repository.

**Sequence Alignment**

The program solves the sequence alignment problem and prints some
statistics related to the solution, including the three best-aligned
sequence pairs.

To use the program, start the SALSA name server:

    java -cp salsa-1.1.5.jar wwc.naming.WWCNamingServer

and all the theaters listed in the theaters file, beginning with the
*second* line (the first line is the name server):

    java -cp salsa-1.1.5.jar:. wwc.messaging.Theater $PORT

then run the program:

    java -cp salsa-1.1.5.jar:. seqalign.SeqAlign seqs nactors theaters

**Building**

The program is written in SALSA with some Java code to work around the lack
of generics support in the SALSA compiler. It can be built with the
included Makefile.
